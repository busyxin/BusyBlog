## My current ventures are:

* **<a href="https://zealsio.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zealsio</a>** my development agency for web and mobile projects which is a continuation of my work as a freelancer. There is a clear vision and mission behind it that makes it stand from other agencies, will update this as soon as I can.
* **<a href="https://www.psychedelics-integration.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psychedelics Integration</a>**, this is my startup project where, along with my co-founder Andr√©s and first collaborator Hannah, we try to bring Harm Reduction principle to the masses and help as many people as we can through their Psychedelic Journey.

## Then my side projects:

* **<a href="https://vani.studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VANI Studio</a>**, a safe place where nudity plays a central role in learning to accept oneself. We use this element to counter the distortion created by the modern times and especially social media. Have you ever heard that people go shopping when they are sad? Well, Instagram and co. do the same thing, they make you feel like shit with yourself and the next thing they do is to serve you a targeted ad like a missile.
* **<a href="https://icedippers.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice Dippers Berlin</a>**, I am really glad to be part of the community of ice dippers in Berlin. In here you can find formidable people. The fact that we are gathering just to practice such a dreadful activity makes it a great auto-filter that warranties very singular individuals will join.
* Secret LGBTQ+ project
