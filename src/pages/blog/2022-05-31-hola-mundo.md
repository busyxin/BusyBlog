Hi everyone, and thanks for checking this out. As billions of developers, creators, influencers and other wannabes, I am starting a blog, wow..! Usually the intro goes along like: this is my personal musing about xyz.

So which are mine? Simply put:

* **Personal transformation**, I will be mostly researching about growth by exposing myself out of the comfort zone. My areas of interest revolve around:

  * Nudity, body-positivity and self-acceptance. Quoting Yuval Noah Harari: "If you don't feel home in your body, you won't feel home in the world". 
  * Psychedelics, nature talks to us directly through plant medicine.
  * Physical conditioning: heat and cold exposure, breath-work and physical endurance.
* **Permaculture and plants**
* **Geodesic domes and Solarpunk**
* **Bizarre project ideas**
* **Books**

I take the chance of blogging as an exercise for myself to write better, to recapture my attention span and focus and to improve my communication skills. In order to "succeed" (define success, right?), it is imperative to communicate effectively. This applies to both personal and professional life. I will revisit every blog post frequently and update them.
